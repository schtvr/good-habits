# Getting Started
run npm i on the server and the client root folders and then follow these instuctions to run the app on an android emulator: https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device

In the client folder, run the following command:
```npm install```
You will need to create a .env file in the client folder with holds the LOCALURL declaration - e.g.: ```LOCALURL=https://192.168.2.150:3000```

If you plan on hosting a local version, you will need to run the following command from the server folder:
```npm install```

The server can be initialized by running ```npm start``` from the server directory.
The client can be initialized by running ```npm run android``` from the client directory.
